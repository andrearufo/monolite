# Monolite

A monolithique blogging platform without database

## What is Monolite

Monolite is a super simple blogging platform that allow you to compose your articles in Markdown syntax.

Just create a .md file and publish it in the `articles` folder and the script will make the magic.

### What does it mean...

Nothing! Just *mono* for only one file and *lite* because it's a light solution.

## Config

Nothing to install or to launch: just open the `index.php` file and modify the config array with your info. Upload all to a webserver and... that's all!

## Screenshot

This is a simple theme for the Monolite standard page.
